            Jaipur, the capital city of Rajasthan is a vibrant metropolis known
            as the Pink City, due to its distinctively coloured buildings.
            Founded in 1727, it is named Jaipur after its founder-ruler, Sawai
            Jai Singh II.

            Vidya Sagar Bhattacharya was the chief architect of Jaipur. He was
            well-versed in urban planning and architecture and designed the city
            to be symmetrical with wide arterial roads with intersecting streets
            and lanes at right angles. The city’s layout was designed according
            to Vastu Shastra, meaning the science of architecture¸ a Hindu
            system of design that balances the five elements of nature and
            elements from astronomy and astrology. It emphasizes harmony and
            prosperity. Jaipur had temples, gardens, havelis and civic buildings
            devoted to specific activities. They were also forts and resting
            places for travellers.

          <p class="font-regular text-white lg:text-lg text-sm lg:mb-8 mb-5">
            There are numerous reports of Jaipur and its architectural beauty.
            An 1832 account of Jaipur and Amber by a French scholar reads,
          </p>
          <p class="italic text-white lg:text-lg text-sm lg:mb-8 mb-5">
            “The main streets are the principle bazaars; on each side, under the
            arcades of the palaces, temples, and houses, are the shops of the
            artisans, who are seen working almost in the open air at the trades,
            the Tailors, Shoemakers, Goldsmiths, armourers, pastry-cooks,
            confectioners, coppersmiths, etc. The merchants occupy very
            spacious, hot hatch, constructed a sort of course let work, in the
            midst of the main streets.”

          <p class="font-regular text-white lg:text-lg text-sm lg:mb-8 mb-5">
            Jaipur was designed with 8 gates – named after the Sun, Moon, North
            Star, two Hindu deities, Ram and Shiv, the Ajmeri Gate (that leads
            to Ajmer that houses a sacred shrine revered in Islam) and Ganga and
            Naya.

            The City Palace, Hawa Mahal, and Amber Fort stand as magnificent
            reminders of the architectural prowess of the Kachwaha dynasty.
            These monuments are more than just buildings – they are symbols of a
            dynasty that nurtured art, culture, and scholarship

          <p class="font-regular text-white lg:text-lg text-sm lg:mb-8 mb-5">
            Jaipur’s cultural influence flourished under the patronage of its
            rulers, with grand festivals, intricate jewellery, and elaborate
            textile craftsmanship reflecting the city’s royal roots. The
            Kachwaha kings, known for their architectural ingenuity, developed
            Jaipur into a city of elegance and grandeur, which continues to
            attract visitors from around the world.

          <p class="font-regular text-white lg:text-lg text-sm lg:mb-8 mb-5">
            Today, Jaipur’s royal heritage is not just preserved in its palaces
            and forts, but also in the traditions, music, and art that continue
            to thrive in the modern city. Every corner of Jaipur tells a story –
            of its kings, their ambitions, and their enduring impact on Indian
            culture.

              Jaipur’s Strategic Importance to the Mughals
            </h2>
            <p class="font-regular text-white lg:text-lg text-sm lg:mb-8 mb-5">
              The route from Delhi to Ajmer was through Jaipur and access to
              Ajmer was important for the Mughals. Ajmer is home to shrine or
              dargah of one of Islam’s most revered saint and scholar, Mu'in
              al-Din Hasan Chishti Sijzi. He was a Sufi preacher in the early
              13th century and founder of the Chishtiyya mysticism of the Sunni
              order. It is said that Muhammad bin Tughluq (reigned from 1324 to
              1351) visited the tomb in 1332 and Mughal Emperor Akbar visited
              the shrine 14 times during his reign. When Chishti died, his tomb
              in Ajmer became a venerated site, accessible only through Jaipur
              from Delhi (or Shahjahanabad).
