              CHIEF ARCHITECT OF THE JANTAR MANTAR

              Imagine a young scholar in the early 1700s in India who could read
              and write in Sanskrit, Arabic and Persian. Then imagine a
              mathematician and architect. Pandit Jagannath Samrat, chief
              advisor to Sawai Jai Singh II was all this and more – he was also
              as astronomer.
            </p>
            <p class="italic text-black lg:text-lg text-sm lg:mb-8 mb-5">
              “Sawai Jai Singh, shortly after his ascension was summoned to the
              imperial Mughal camp in the Deccan….While in the Deccan, one day,
              after one such campaign, Jai Singh was riding back to camp with
              his men. On the way, in one of the villages that he passed
              through, Jai Singh met a young Brahmin scholar, Jagannath, the son
              of Ganesa. Pandit Jagannath came from a traditional family of
              astronomers. So impressed was Sawai Jai Sing with the young Pandit
              that he not only requested him to accompany him to his camp, but
              also persuaded him to come north with him to Amber, even bestowing
              the title of ‘Samrat’ on him in deference to his supreme
              learning.”

              Jagannath Samrat was instrumental in the construction of the
              Jantar Mantar. He chose the site in Jaipur, had the ground
              levelled, identified the directions and set about designing it,
              along with his equally erudite ruler, Jai Singh.

            <p class="font-regular text-black lg:text-lg text-sm lg:mb-8 mb-5">
              Jagannath was fascinated by Euclid, the Greek mathematician (from
              circa 300 BC) and the Father of Geometry. He translated Euclid's
              Elements into Sanskrit in 1719 (from the Arabic translation of
              Elements by Nasir al-Din al-Tusi) in a work titled Rekhāgaṇita.

            <p class="font-regular text-black lg:text-lg text-sm lg:mb-8 mb-5">
              Jai Singh had a collection of astrolabes, each exquisitely
              crafted. He understood their value in the study of astronomy and
              commissioned four manuals on astrolabes and other instruments.
              Jagannath Samrat compiled the first of these manuals,
              Yantraprakāra, on various astronomical instruments, measurements,
              computations and observations. While the Arabic and Persian works
              were in verse form, Jai Singh preferred prose for the translated
              works.

            <p class="font-regular text-black lg:text-lg text-sm lg:mb-8 mb-5">
              Vidya Sagar Bhattacharya was the chief architect of Jaipur. He was
              well-versed in urban planning and architecture and designed the
              city to be symmetrical with wide arterial roads with intersecting
              streets and lanes at right angles. The city’s layout was designed
              according to Vastu Shastra, meaning the science of architecture¸ a
              Hindu system of design that balances the five elements of nature
              and elements from astronomy and astrology. It emphasizes harmony
              and prosperity. Jaipur had temples, gardens, havelis and civic
              buildings devoted to specific activities. They were also forts and
              resting places for travellers.
